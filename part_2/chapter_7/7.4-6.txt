Let X1, X2, X3 be the position of the elements randomly chosen from the array,
and M be the position of the median of those elements.
We seek P(nα < M < n(1 - α)) = 1 - 2P(M < α).

Ignoring any round-off errors,
   P(M < α) = P(at least two of X1, X2, X3 < α)
            = 3α^2(1 - α) + α^3
⇒  1 - 2P(M < α) = 1 - 6α^2 + 4α^3.
