Suppose that "almost sorted" means that the distance between each element's
initial position in the array and its position after sorting is at most c for
some constant c.
The the runtime of insertion sort is O(cn) = O(n), but PARTITION will result in
partitions of size n - c and c at best, which leads to Î˜(n^2) runtime for QUICKSORT.
