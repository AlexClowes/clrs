For a randomised algorithm, there is no input that always causes the worst-case
behaviour. Instead, the worst-case behaviour could happen for any input, but with
a very low probability (approaching zero as n → ∞).
Instead we care about the expected runtime, which is likely to be similar to the
actual runtime in a real-world situation with diverse inputs.
