In the worst case, Θ(n) calls are made to RANDOM, (with probability O(1 / n^n)).
In the worst case, 
In the best case, Θ(n) calls 

Let R(n) be the number of calls made to random, so R(1) = 0.
In the worst case, R(n) = R(n - 1) + 1 ⇒ R(n) = n - 1 = Θ(n).
In the best case, R(n) = 2R(n / 2) + 1 ⇒ R(2^n) = 2^n - 1 ⇒ R(n) = Θ(n).
