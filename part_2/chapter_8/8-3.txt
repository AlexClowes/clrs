a. First, we can sort the numbers by their number of digits, using an O(n) sorting
   method. Then we can split the numbers into groups according to the number of
   digits that they have, and sort each group using radix sort. Concatenating the
   sorted groups will return the entire sorted array.

b. Sort the strings into buckets according to their first letters. Then for each
   bucket, further sort the strings according to their second letters, and continue
   to recurse in this fashion.
