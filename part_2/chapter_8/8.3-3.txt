Claim: After the nth iteration of radix sort, all elements of the array are
       sorted by their last n digits.

This is trivially true when n = 1.
Suppose this is true for n and false for n + 1. Then there are two elements in
the array which are not sorted by their last n + 1 digits. They must have the
same digit in the n + 1th place, because we have just sorted by that. Since the
sort is stable, they are sorted according to their positions in the previous
iteration, which were sorted by induction. Contradiction.
