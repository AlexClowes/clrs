Insertion sort and merge sort are stable. Heap sort and quick sort are not stable.

Suppose we have an comparison sort that sorts an array A[1 .. n]. This algorithm
can be made stable by sorting on keys (A[i], i), where we say
(A[i], i) < (A[j], j]) if A[i] < A[j] or A[i] = A[j] and i < j.
This has no effect on the asymptotic runtime or memory use of the algorithm.
