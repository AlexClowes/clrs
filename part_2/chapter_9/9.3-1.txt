If we divide into groups of 7, the recurrence relation becomes
T(n) ≤ T(ceil(n/7)) + T(5n/7 + 8) + O(n),
and by the same substitution method as before this gives T(n) = O(n).

If we divide into groups of 3, the recurrence in the worst case is
T(n) = T(ceil(n/3)) + T(2n/3 + 4) + O(n)
     ≥ T(n/3) + T(2n/3) + O(n)
If T(m) ≥ cmlog(m) ∀ m < c, then
T(n) ≥ c(n/3)log(n/3) + c(2n/3)log(2n/3) + O(n)
     = cnlog(n) + O(n)
So T(n) = O(nlog(n)) if we use groups of 3.
