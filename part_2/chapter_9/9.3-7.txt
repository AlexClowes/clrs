First, find the median of the numbers.
Second, compute the absolute value of the difference between each number and the
median.
Third, find the kth order statistic of the absolute differences.
Finally, take every number with absolute difference less than or equal to the
kth order statistic.

Each of these steps can be completed in O(n) time, so the total runtime is O(n).
