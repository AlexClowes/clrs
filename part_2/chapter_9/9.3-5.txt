Let n be the number of elements in the array.
If i = floor((n + 1) / 2), then the ith order statistic is the median, and the
black-box algorithm finds this in linear time. Otherwise, we find the median
element with the black-box algorithm and partition the elements using the median
as the partition element. If i < floor((n + 1) / 2) we recurse, seeking the ith
order statistic of the left partition. If i > floor((n + 1) / 2) we recurse,
seeking the (i - floor((n + 1) / 2))th order statistic of the right partition.

The runtime is thus T(n) ≤ T(n / 2) + O(n) ⇒ T(n) = O(n).
