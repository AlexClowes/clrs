For an array A[1 .. n] containing n elements, let A[i_1] < ... < A[i_{k-1}] be
the kth quantiles.
We can find A[i_{floor(k/2)}] in linear time, then partition the array using this
as the partition element. Then half of the remaining kth quantiles lie in the left
partition, and half of the remaining kth quantiles lie in the right partition, and
we can recurse to find them.
The runtime is T(n, k) ≤ 2T(n/2, k/2) + O(n) ⇒ T(n, k) = O(nlog(k)).
