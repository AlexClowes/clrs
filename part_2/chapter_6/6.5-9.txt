Build a min heap containing the first element of each of the k lists.
To merge the lists, take the first element from the min heap, and then insert
the next element from the corresponding list if it exists. Continue doing this
until every list and the heap are empty.

Building the initial min heap takes O(k) time, and we then do n insertions which
take O(log(k)) time each. So the total time is O(nlog(k)).
