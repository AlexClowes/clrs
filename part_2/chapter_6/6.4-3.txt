The call to BUILD-MAX-HEAP will run in O(n) time whether the array is sorted in
increasing or decreasing order.
Assuming that not all elements are the same, then each call to MAX-HEAPIFY will
take O(log(i)) time for i = n, n - 1, ..., 2.
So the total runtime is O(nlog(n)) in both cases.

In the trivial case where all elements are identical, the array is technically
sorted in both increasing and decreasing order, and the runtime is O(n).
