We assume n is a power of two, so set n = 2^k for some positive integer k.

In the case k = 1, we have
T(2^k) = T(2) = 2 = 2lg(2)
as required.

Suppose
T(n) = nlg(n) <=> T(2^k) = k * 2^k
for some value of k. Then
T(2^(k+1)) = 2T(2^k) + 2^(k + 1)
           = 2 * k * 2^k + 2^(k + 1)
           = (k + 1) * 2^(k + 1)

So by induction, T(2^k) = k * 2^k for all positive integers k, and hence for all
powers of 2 greater than 1, we have T(n) = nlg(n).
