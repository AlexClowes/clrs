Assume we have a procedure Sort, which sorts a set of numbers in O(nlog(n)) time.
Then the following pseudocode will determine whether there exist two elements in
S whose sum is exactly x.

Sort(S)
lo = 1
hi = S.length
while lo < hi
    sum = S[lo] + S[hi]
    if sum == x
        return True
    if sum < x
        // sum is too small, so increase the lower of the two numbers
        lo = lo + 1
    else
        hi = hi - 1
return False

The code after the sort runs in O(n) time, so the total runtime is O(nlog(n)).
