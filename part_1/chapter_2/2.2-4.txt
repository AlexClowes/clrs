We can modify almost any algorithm to start by producing a random value that is
correct for some input, and then check if it is correct for the particular input.
If it is correct, we can terminate immediately, and if not we continue with the
original algorithm.
In the best case, our random guess is correct, so the best case running time will
be fast.
