The shortest-path and traveling salesman problems both require an agent to find
the shortest route along the edges of a graph subject to some constraint.

The shortest-path problem requires us to start and end at two particular points,
while the traveling salesman problem requires us to start and end at the same
point, while visiting certain points along the route.
