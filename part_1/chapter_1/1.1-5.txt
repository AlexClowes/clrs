An approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem is usually fine.
e.g. if we are plotting a delivery route, then taking a route that is only
     marginally slower is not a problem.

An exact solution is required for most sorting problems.
e.g. a dictionary with words in approximately alphabetical order would not be
     very useful.
