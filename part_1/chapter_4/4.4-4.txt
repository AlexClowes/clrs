By inspection, T(n) = 2^n * (T(0) + 1) - 1 = O(2^n).

The tree has depth â‰¤ n, so the total runtime is bounded above by
1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n + 1) - 1 = O(2^n).

Suppose T(n) = 2^n * (T(0) + 1) - 1 (clearly true for n = 0). Then
T(n + 1) = 2T(n) + 1
         = 2^(n + 1) * (T(0) + 1) - 2 + 1
         = 2^(n + 1) * (T(0) + 1) - 1
So T(n) = O(2^n).
