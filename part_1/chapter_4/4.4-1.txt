The tree has ≤ log2(n) layers, so, the total runtime is bounded above by
n(1 + 3/2 + 9/4 + ... + (3/2)^(log2(n) - 1)) = O(n^log2(3))

Suppose T(m) ≤ cm^log2(3) - dm ∀ m < n. Then
T(n) = 3T(floor(n / 2)) + n
     ≤ 3cfloor(n / 2)^log2(3) - 3dfloor(n / 2) + n
     ≤ cn^log2(3) - dn + (1 + d)n - 3dfloor(n / 2)
     ≤ cn^log2(3) - dn
so long as
(1 + d)n - 3dfloor(n / 2) ≤ 0
which is true so long as
d > 2 and n ≥ 3d / (d - 2).

So T(n) = O(n^log2(3)).
