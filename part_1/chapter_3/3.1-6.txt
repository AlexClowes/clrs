Let Tw(n) and Tb(n) be the worst and best case running times respectively. Then
Tw(n) = O(g(n)) => There exist cw, Nw s.t. for all n > Nw, Tw(n) <= cw * g(n)
Tb(n) = Omega(g(n)) => There exist cb, Nb s.t. for all n > Nb, Tb(n) >= cb * g(n)

Then for any n > max(Nw, Nb), we have
cb * g(n) <= Tb(n) <= Tw(n) <= cw * g(n).

Since Tb and Tw bound the running time, we have that the runtime is Theta(g(n)).
