We always hire the first candidate, so to hire exactly two candidates, we must
hire exactly one more candidate, who will be the best candidate (and so the first
candidate cannot be the best).
Suppose the first candidate is candidate i. Then there are n - i candidates better
than i, and candidate n must be the first to appear among these candidates, which
happens with probability 1 / (n - i).
Since we could have i = 1, 2, ..., n - 1 each with probability 1/n, the probability
of making exactly two hires is Î£_{i=1}^{n-1} 1 / n * 1 / (n - i) = H_n / n,
where H_n is the nth harmonic number.
