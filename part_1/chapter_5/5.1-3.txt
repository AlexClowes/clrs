a = BIASED-RANDOM()
b = BIASED-RANDOM()
while a != b
    a = b
    b = BIASED-RANDOM()
return a

In any given iteration of the while loop, there is a probability 2p(1-p) that a
and b are different, so the function terminates. So the expected number of iterations
is 1 / (2p(1-p)), and hence the runtime is Î˜(1 / (p(1 - p))).
