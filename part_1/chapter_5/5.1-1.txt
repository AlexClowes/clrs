We can always determine which of two candidates is best. This defines a relation
R, where for any two candidates a and b we write aRb if candidate a is the best
candidate out of a and b. Then:
i.   For any candidate a, aRa.
ii.  For any candidates a, b, and c, aRb and bRc ⇒  aRc.
iii. For any candidates a and b, aRb ↔ not bRa.
iv.  For any candidates a and b, either aRb or bRa.
So R is a total relation and we have a total ordering on the set of candidates.
