A k-permutation of letters taken from a set of size n is a collection of k letters
which are all different. So this is the probability of randomy choosing k distinct
elments from a set of size n. i.e. this is the Birthday problem.

The probability of choosing a k-permutation is
Î _{r=0}^{k-1}((n - r) / n) = k! * nCr(n, k) / n^k.
