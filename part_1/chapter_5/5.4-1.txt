Suppose we have n people in the room. Then
P(someone shares my birthday) = 1 - P(nobody shares my birthday)
                              = 1 - (364 / 365)^n
So we need to find the smallest n s.t.
   1 - (364 / 365)^n ≥ 1 / 2
⇒  n ≥ log(2) / log(365 / 364) ~ 252.7
So n = 253.

  P(at least two people born on 4th July)
= 1 - P(nobody born on 4th July - P(1 person born on 4th July
= 1 - (364 / 365)^n - n(1 / 365)(364 / 365)^(n - 1)
The smallest n for which this is ≥ 1/2 is 613.
