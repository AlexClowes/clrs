Assume that the list L has a head attribute, which is just a pointer to some
arbitrary element in the list.

INSERT(L, x)
    x.next = L.head.next
    L.head.next = x

DELETE(L, x)
    prev = x
    while prev.next ≠ x
        prev = prev.next
    prev.next = x.next

SEARCH(L, k)
    x = L.head
    do
        if x.key == k
            return x
        x = x.next
    while x ≠ L.head
    return NIL
