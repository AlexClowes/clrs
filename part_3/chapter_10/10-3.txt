a. COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L, n, k, t) attempts to skip ahead to a randomly chosen
   position j times. If it does not find the key after t skips, it reverts to a
   linear search of the remaining elements. So if an element with the correct
   key is present it returns that element, otherwise it returns NIL. So it
   returns the same value as COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH(L, n, k).
   On each iteration of the while loop in COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH, we attempt to
   skip ahead, then move to the next element in the list. So it takes at least t
   random skips to find the correct value in the list. So COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'
   performs at least t iterations of the for loop, and some (non-negative)
   number of iterations of the while loop.

b. First we make t iterations through the for loop, which takes O(t) time. Then
   we are distance X_t from the correct element, and taking X_t steps through
   the list takes O(E[X_t]) expected time. So the total expected time is
   O(t + E[X_t]).

c. Suppose the element with key k is the mth smallest element in the list. Then
   the probability that X_t ≥ r for 0 ≤ r < m is the probability that each of
   the randomly chosen elements j are not one of the kth, (k-1)th, ..., (k-r+1)th
   smallest elements. The js are indpendent uniform random variables over {1, .., n}.
   ∴ P(X_t ≥ r) = (1 - r/n)^t
   ⇒ E[X_t] = Σ_{r=1}^m P(X_t ≥ r) ≤ Σ_{r=1}^n P(X_t ≥ r) = Σ_{r=1}^n (1 - r/n)^t.

d. Σ_{r=0}^n(1 - r/n)^t ≤ ∫_0^n x^t dx = n^(t + 1) / (t + 1).

e. E[X_t] ≤ Σ_{r=1}^n (1 - r/n)^t
          = n^-t Σ_{r=0}^{n-1} r^t
          ≤ n / (t + 1).

f. COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'(L, n, k, t) runs in
   O(t + E[X_t]) = O(t + n / (t + 1)) = O(t + n / t) time.

g. COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH has asymptotic runtime at least as good as
   COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH'. If we choose t = √n, then COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH' has
   O(t + n / t) = O(√n) runtime, and hence COMPACT-LIST-SEARCH has O(√n) runtime.

h. If keys are not distinct, then we may randomly choose j that is further along
   in the list than i, and where key[i] = key[j] < k. Then we would not take this
   skip. So the above analysis does not work and the bound on E[X_t] may not hold.
