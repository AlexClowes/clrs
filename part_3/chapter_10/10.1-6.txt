Suppose we have two stacks, S1 and S2. Then we can implement a queue Q as
follows:

ENQUEUE(Q, x)
    PUSH(S1, x)

DEQUEUE(Q)
    if EMPTY(S2)
        while not EMPTY(S1)
            PUSH(S2, POP(S1))
    if EMPTY(S2)
        error "underflow"
    return POP(S2)

ENQUEUE takes Θ(1) time.
DEQUEUE takes O(n) time in the worst case, but Θ(1) amortized time.
